# DrzewoAVL and Singleton

## Description

The projects `DrzewoAVL` and `Singleton` present different aspects of programming in C#. The first project concerns the implementation of the AVL Tree data structure, which provides efficient insertion and searching of data. The second project demonstrates the application of the Singleton design pattern, which ensures that only one instance of a class exists in the application.

## Goal

### DrzewoAVL

- Implementation of an efficient binary tree ensuring balanced branch heights.
- Providing insertion and searching operations with logarithmic time complexity.

### Singleton

- Application of the Singleton design pattern to ensure that only one instance of the `MyClass` class exists.
- Demonstrating how Singleton can be used in practice to control access to application resources.
